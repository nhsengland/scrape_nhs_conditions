This makes swallowing easier and less painful for some people, although they do not work for everyone.</p><p>The effect only lasts for a short time, so medicine may be used to ease symptoms while you wait for a more permanent treatment. They may cause headaches, but this usually improves over time.</p><h3>Stretching the muscle (balloon dilation)</h3><p>Under a sedative, or sometimes a <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/general-anaesthesia/\\\">general anaesthetic</a>, a balloon is passed into the oesophagus using a long, thin flexible tube (<a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/endoscopy/\\\">endoscope</a>). The balloon is then inflated to help stretch the ring of muscle that lets food into your stomach.</p><p>This improves swallowing for most people, but you may need treatment several times before your symptoms improve.</p><p>Balloon dilatation does carry a small risk of tearing the oesophagus (oesophageal rupture), which may require emergency surgery.</p><h3>Botox injection</h3><p>Using an endoscope, botox is injected into the ring of muscle that lets food into your stomach, causing it to relax.</p><p>It is usually effective for a few months and occasionally for a few years, but it has to be repeated. This is usually painless, and can be used for temporary relief in people who are not able to have other treatments.</p><h3>Surgery</h3><p>Under general anaesthetic, the muscle fibres in the ring of muscle that lets food into your stomach are cut. This is done using keyhole surgery (<a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/laparoscopy/\\\">laparoscopy</a>) and is called Heller's myotomy.</p><p>It can permanently make swallowing easier.</p><p>Often a second procedure will be done at the same time to stop you getting <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/heartburn-and-acid-reflux/\\\">acid reflux and heartburn</a>, which can be a side effect of the Heller's myotomy operation. Your surgeon will talk to you about this and any other surgical options which may be the best option for you.</p><h3>Follow-up treatment</h3><p>Balloon dilation and surgery can both cause side effects such as <a href=\\\"https://api.nhs.uk/conditions/heartburn-and-acid-reflux/\\\">acid reflux and heartburn</a> and chest pain.
